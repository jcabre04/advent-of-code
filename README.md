My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). Completed these challenges by using test driven development. In short, I created test cases first and completed logic to satisfy those tests second.

# Run tests
To run tests, 
1. install poetry and the project's dependencies (.lock and .toml files)
2. download a copy of this directory
2. run pytest from the root directory (`poetry run pytest`)
